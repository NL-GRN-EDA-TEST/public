# Hello world !!!

This repository is only used to test a `Public` (so **not** `Internal`) repository.
By far the most of the repositories should be `Private` to keep all customer related information confidential.

This organisation should *only* contain a limited number of `Internal` public repositories (named `public` or `public-*`)
containing information that should be accessible to all members of this enterprise,
