# Hello world !!!

This repository is *only* used to test a `Public` (so **not** `Internal`) repository.
Nearly all of our repositories should be `Private` to keep all customer related information confidential.

Only a limited number of `Internal` public repositories (named `public` or `public-*`) should exist,
containing information that is accessible to all members of this enterprise.
