# Hello world !!!

This repository is *only* used to test a `Public` (so **not** `Internal`) repository that is accessible to the world.

Only a limited number of `Internal` repositories (named `internal` or `internal-*`) should exist,
containing information that is accessible to all members of this enterprise (requiring company PKI login).

Nearly all of our repositories should be `Private` to keep all customer related information confidential.
